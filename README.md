## Combo Box developed using Behavior Driven Development:##
The development cycle roughly is as follows:<br> 
First the specification is written out using Mocha framework<br>
An expectation is created using the Chai api<br>
Test fails<br>
The feature is implemented until the test passes.<br>
<br>
rinse and repeat until all specifications are met.
